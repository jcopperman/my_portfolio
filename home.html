      <h2>Leadership Skills and Experience</h2>
      <p>For over a decade I have worked as a Senior or QA Lead, or even on my own as a consultant or one man team. I have a track record of working well with developers, have built relations with both mentors and being a mentor and I have led engineering teams on my own. I value Trust, Curiosity and Humility with whom I work with.</p>

      <h2>Test Automation</h2>
      <p>I see test automation as code, as it should. Code requires careful consideration and can become a mantainence headache but I have a few tricks I have learned that I hope to share. I consider myself a Selenium guru and a Cypress patron. I also love API testing and use Postman more than social media!</p>

      <h2>Terminal Skills</h2>
      <p>I am no stranger to the terminal/command line/console. I grew up writing batch files and soon moved to bash. I like working with bare metal both metaphorically and in software engineering. I am also a tinkerer and I'm always building custom tooling to get the job done!</p>

      <h2>DevOps</h2>
      <p>I believe that nothing matters until it is in production! But how do we get there? I talk about the test pyramid and where I believe it fits into the pipeline. Mistakes I have made and seen and what I think we can do to improve on our SDLC! I support Shift-Testing-Left and DevSecOps philosphies and believe QA should function the same way...part of DevOps!</p>

      <h2>Scrum Master</h2>
      <p>I am an accredited scrum master and voluntary worked as a Scrum Master/Delivery Lead for 3 engineering teams. - I can speak of my learnings, challenges and why I still think Agile works. What challenges engineers and business face and how we work together to meet our objectives. </p>

      <h2>Public Speaking</h2>
      <p>I am shy by nature but when necessary I will speak and have been heard! - From my overcoming stage fright and talking about Agile and TDD at Axxess Africa to having hosted Hackathons at companies I have worked for. I enjoy fresh ideas and helping colleagues bring their's to life.</p>

      <h2>Challenges and Conflict Resolution</h2>
      <p>When you work with passionate people, sometimes passion can be hostile - How I dealt with conflict in the workplace. Sometimes you manage up and sometimes down but I stick to my rule: People have good intentions and I prefer to listen before I speak, taking into account everyone's perspectives.</p>

      <h2>Thinking Out of The Box</h2>
      <p>Sometimes engineering maturity is just not ready, that doesn't mean stopping the bus - How I solved complex problems with simple and cost-effective solutions, learned from my mistakes but recovered quickly and always applied the virtue of curiosity to problem-solving and ensuring my team shared a vision.</p>

      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>When I'm not working, walking my parrots, training my dog to say "Polly want's a cracker or teaching my cat's to sit and stay then I enjoy various hobbies such as painting, fishing, playing guitar, and cooking. These activities help me relax and recharge, allowing me to bring a fresh perspective to my work.</p>
